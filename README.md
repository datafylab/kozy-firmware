# kozy-firmware

## Description

Control firmware and software for Kozy-01

It helps synchronize cameras, microcontrollers, and AI models into a single system for robotics...
> But it's not universal yet and only works with RealSense and RPI Pico.

Of course, first of all, this is created for personal projects.
> It's supposed to be a simple replacement for ROS, with various elements to make it easier to configure and modify devices, graphs, etc. But it's still in an incredibly early stage of development, and I don't think anything great will come out of it.
